### Description ###

Adds a new building that can spawn in the world where you can store items indefinitely

### Main Changes ###

- Two Storage Vault Buildings will spawn at random T1 military settlements in new worlds.
- The buildings can only be accessed once you have finished the Make Nobles Aware ambition
- You can use these to permanently store items. Stored food however will still spoil.
- Additional slots must first be unlocked through a one-time payment.
- Some situations may temporarily disable the access to the warehouse

- You can spawn Storage Vaults into existing savegames by calling  '::modVABU.spawnVaultBuildings(2)'  with a dev console mod

### Requirements ###

- Modding Script Hooks
- Modding Standards and Utilities (MSU)

### Known Issues: ###

- onAddedToStash will give items that have no BougthAtPrice a price if you get them while at a town. This is just visual bug
- spawning vaults into existing games has a ~50% of putting them into the top left corner. This is a vanilla bug.

### Compatibility ###

- Adding to existing savegames will have no immediated effect. You have to call '::modVABU.spawnVaultBuildings(2)' in this case
- Can't be removed from running savegames unless you manage to remove all vault buildings from all cities

### Future Plans: ###

- use variables for the name of this building in all labels/descriptions so it can be changed globally
- Move down the labels for amounts on the items down a bit now that the gold cost is gone
- Feature to remove all vault buildings so this mod can be removed from savegames
- Different prices depending on relation/renown/other situations
- Vault shake needs to be applied to vault size label
- Ability to store Tools, Ammunition, Medicine
- New Heist-Event while camping during night by a town with a Vault?
- Event where thief steals key during night to grant you an additional slot for the vault
